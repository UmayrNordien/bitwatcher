Here's a step-by-step process for bootstrapping a Vue project:

First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can check if they are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:
Copy
node -v
npm -v
If Node.js and npm are not installed, you can download and install them from the official Node.js website.

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can create a new Vue project using the Vue CLI. To install the Vue CLI, run the following command in your terminal:
Copy
npm install -g @vue/cli
This will install the Vue CLI globally on your machine.

With the Vue CLI installed, you can create a new Vue project by running the following command:
Copy
vue create project-name
Replace project-name with the name you want to give to your project. This will create a new Vue project in a directory named project-name.

The Vue CLI will prompt you to select a preset for your project. You can choose the default preset or manually select features you want to include in your project. Once you have made your selection, the Vue CLI will install the required dependencies and create the project.

Once the project has been created, navigate to the project directory by running the following command:

Copy
cd project-name
You can now start the development server by running the following command:
Copy
npm run serve
This will start the development server and you can view your Vue project in your web browser at http://localhost:8080.

You can now start building your Vue project by editing the files in the src directory. As you make changes to your project, the development server will automatically reload the page to reflect the changes.
